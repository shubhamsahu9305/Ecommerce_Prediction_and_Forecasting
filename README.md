# Ecommerce Prediction and Forecasting

# Objective
This project covers various machine learning methods for sales prediction, churn prediction, and forecasting, offering practical insights to help grow our business.

# Tools Used
Python, Flask Library and Amazon AWS

# Action
In this project, several machine learning models were applied for the problem and below are the models that performed well:
1) Sales Prediction - XGBoost Regressor
2) Churn Prediction - XGBoost Classifier
3) Revenue Forecasting - ARIMA Model
4) Net Income Forecasting - Triple Exponential Smoothing

After this hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to get the best model parameter.
Web-Page is built using Flask and then it is deployed on Amazon-AWS
